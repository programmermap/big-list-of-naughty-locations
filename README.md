# Big list of naughty locations
The big list of naughty locations contains a list of strings discovered during geocoding that will most likely break it and return wrong results.
It's most useful if you have user-generated locations and want to filter them upfront.
Inspired by [big-list-of-naughty-strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings).
